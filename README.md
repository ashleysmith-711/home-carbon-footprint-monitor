## How It Works

This is a NextJS application with a FastAPI python backend

## Demo

http:/home-carbon-footprint-monitor-oqs5oixwk-ashleysmith-711.vercel.app


## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

Then, run the development server for both the front-end and the API:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In another terminal

```bash
npm run fastapi-dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
